# Countries API

I created a very simple API to find information on countries around the world. Information such as name, region, capital, language, borders, timezone, and population.

## More Information

This API was created through the use of https://restcountries.com

This API offers CRUD functionality in finding, adding, updating, and deleting countries within the API

I hope to continue to add increasingly helpful functionality in the searching aspect of this API

I hope you have a lovely day.
